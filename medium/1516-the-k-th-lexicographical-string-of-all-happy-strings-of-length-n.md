## Problem Description
<p>A <strong>happy string</strong> is a string that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>consists only of letters of the set <code>[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>s[i] != s[i + 1]</code> for all values of <code>i</code> from <code>1</code> to <code>s.length - 1</code> (string is 1-indexed).</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, strings <strong>&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;ac&quot;, &quot;b&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;abcbabcbcb&quot;</strong> are all happy strings and strings <strong>&quot;aa&quot;, &quot;baa&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;ababbc&quot;</strong> are not happy strings.</p>

<p>Given two integers <code>n</code> and <code>k</code>, consider a list of all happy strings of length <code>n</code> sorted in lexicographical order.</p>

<p>Return <em>the kth string</em> of this list or return an <strong>empty string</strong> if there are less than <code>k</code> happy strings of length <code>n</code>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 1, k = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;c&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The list [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;] contains all happy strings of length 1. The third string is &quot;c&quot;.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 1, k = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are only 3 happy strings of length 1.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 3, k = 9
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;cab&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are 12 different happy string of length 3 [&quot;aba&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;aca&quot;, &quot;acb&quot;, &quot;bab&quot;, &quot;bac&quot;, &quot;bca&quot;, &quot;bcb&quot;, &quot;cab&quot;, &quot;cac&quot;, &quot;cba&quot;, &quot;cbc&quot;]. You will find the 9<sup>th</sup> string = &quot;cab&quot;
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= 100</code></li>
</ul>

## Solution
1. **Initial Thoughts**

- **Problem analysis**: 
   - The problem asks to find the k-th lexicographical string of all happy strings of length n.
   - A happy string is a string that consists only of letters from the set {'a', 'b', 'c'} and no two adjacent characters are the same.
   - The list of happy strings of length n can be generated by recursion.
   - The k-th string in the list can be found by using the formula: k = (i - 1) * 3 + j, where i is the index of the first character and j is the index of the second character.

- **Key observations**: 
   - The number of happy strings of length n is 3 ^ n.
   - The first character of a happy string can be any of the three letters {'a', 'b', 'c'}.
   - The second character of a happy string can be any of the three letters {'a', 'b', 'c'} except the first character.
   - The third character of a happy string can be any of the three letters {'a', 'b', 'c'} except the first and second characters.

- **Possible approaches**: 
   - Generate all the happy strings of length n and find the k-th string.
   - Use the formula to find the k-th string directly.

2. **Solution Implementation**
```python
def getHappyString(n: int, k: int) -> str:
    """
    Finds the k-th lexicographical string of all happy strings of length n.

    Args:
        n: The length of the happy string.
        k: The index of the happy string to find.

    Returns:
        The k-th lexicographical string of all happy strings of length n.
    """

    # Initialize the string to the first happy string.
    string = 'a'

    # Iterate over the remaining characters in the string.
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Find the next happy character.
        next_char = 'a'
        if string[i - 1] == 'a':
            next_char = 'b'
        elif string[i - 1] == 'b':
            next_char = 'c'

        # Append the next happy character to the string.
        string += next_char

    # If the k-th string is greater than the number of happy strings of length n, return an empty string.
    if k > 3 ** n:
        return ""

    # Return the k-th string.
    return string[k - 1]
```

3. **Solution Explanation**

- The solution uses the formula to find the k-th happy string directly.
- The formula is k = (i - 1) * 3 + j, where i is the index of the first character and j is the index of the second character.
- The solution first initializes the string to the first happy string, which is 'a'.
- Then, the solution iterates over the remaining characters in the string and finds the next happy character for each position.
- The happy character is found by using the formula: next_char = 'a' if string[i - 1] == 'b' else 'c'.
- The next happy character is then appended to the string.
- If the k-th string is greater than the number of happy strings of length n, the solution returns an empty string.
- Otherwise, the solution returns the k-th string.

4. **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the happy string.
- **Space complexity**: O(1), as the solution does not use any additional data structures.
